&emsp;I've been a *nix user for a few years now -- 6 to be exact. But only recently have I started to use multiple configurable terminal programs. By convention, programs are configured by hidden files (starting with a dot) stored in a users /home/ directory. Some examples include `.tmux.conf`, `.vimrc`, `.zprofile`.

One of the best resources I found for this project was from [Luke Smith's Github page](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice).
