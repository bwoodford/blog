After reading a short article posted on lobste.rs this weekend, I felt obligated to finally look into what a Fourier Transform was. I've always been curious as to the practical uses of it, hearing how it makes many things in digital music possible â€” I even remember hearing University Mathematics teachers talk about its contributions to modern day life. The article that brought back this curiosity was titled ["The Fourier Transform, explained in one sentence"](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/01/the-fourier-transform-explained-in-one-sentence.html). The explanation of:
> To find the energy at a particular frequency, spin your signal around a circle at that frequency, and average a bunch of points along that path.

seemed nice and picturesque, but really lacks the fundamentals of what's happening. I went to my favorite math resource [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) to see if his videos could point me in the right direction. Using the videos titled:
 - ["But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction"](https://youtu.be/spUNpyF58BY)
 - ["Euler's formula with introductory group theory"](https://youtu.be/mvmuCPvRoWQ?t=922)
 I came to understand the notion of the text from the lobste.rs link above.
