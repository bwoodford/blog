Hello! My name is Brandon Woodford, and if you haven't guessed, I'm a Software Developer. 

This is my local webspace for discussing my thoughts, opinions, and personal projects. My interests include programming languages, algorithms, and cryptography. I'm also an avid *nix user and supporter of software freedom and digital privacy. In my freetime, I usually tinker with computer hardware and electronics. 

Currently, I work for [Solutia Consulting](https://www.solutiaconsulting.com) as an Associate Consultant, where I help clients with creating and maintaining software solutions. 

Here are some other places you can find me:
* [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/u/ivegotnorto)
* [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@woodfobm)
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=woodfordb)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/IveGotNorto)

You can also reach me by [email](mailto:ivegotnorto@protonmail.com), and if need be, using my GPG key: [`66AB E715 9556 9A09 22EC`](/files/public.gpg)

Thanks for visiting.

*-Brandon*
