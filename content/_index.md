Hiya, I'm Brandon Woodford, a software developer based in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. I created this blog to share my personal coding projects and shed light on topics I find interesting.

Currently, I work at Solutia Consulting as a Consultant specializing in Full Stack Web Development. Through Solutia, I've worked with diverse clients including startups and mid-sized corporations. As a Consultant, I love that I get to constantly keep learning and building relationships with diverse groups of people.

In my role, I get to work on projects across the full stack from databases and servers to front-end UIs and back-end APIs. I enjoy problem-solving and finding creative solutions to complex technical challenges!

Outside of work, I like experimenting with new programming languages, and frameworks, on personal projects. I also enjoy reading about technology, philosophy, and science while staying active through exercising and backpacking.

I started this blog to share my perspectives on the intersection of tech, science, and philosophy. I hope to showcase my curiosity, passion for coding, and progress as I continue growing as a developer.

Feel free to reach out to me by sending an email to the current URL - I'd love to hear from you!
