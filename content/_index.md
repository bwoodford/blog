Hello! I'm Brandon Woodford, a Software Developer based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

Currently, I work at Solutia Consulting as a Full Stack Web Developer. Through Solutia, I've worked with many different clients including startups and corporations. As a Consultant, I love that I get to constantly keep learning and building relationships with diverse groups of people.

In my role, I get to work on projects across the full stack, from databases and servers, to front-end UIs and back-end APIs. I enjoy problem-solving and finding creative solutions to complex problems.

Outside of work, I like experimenting with new programming languages. I also enjoy reading about technology, philosophy, and science while staying active through strength training and hiking.

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woodfobm/) -- I'd love to hear from you!
